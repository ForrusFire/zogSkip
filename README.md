This is a machine learning project that aims to generate original piano music based off the works of multitudes of 
composers and musicians in different genres. The initial proof-of-concept phase of the project will focus on
classical music, with the hopes of creating repeated melodic and harmonic structures that resemble constructed music.
The next phase will use the same ML architecture on MIDI files of anime soundtracks; this will test if the algorithm
can pick up and replicate simpler music with less data. The last phase will include contemporary classical music and
nuanced harmonies and measures.
