This is a machine learning project that aims to generate original piano music based off the works of several 
composers in different genres. The initial proof-of-concept phase of the project will focus on classical music, 
with the hopes of creating repeated melodic and harmonic structures that resemble constructed music.
The next phase will apply the same ML architecture to MIDI files of anime soundtracks and Final Fantasy pieces; this 
will test if the algorithm can pick up and replicate simpler music with less data. The last phase will include 
contemporary classical music and other pieces with nuanced harmonies and measures.
